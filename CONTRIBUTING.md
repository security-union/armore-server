# Contributing to Armore

üçªüéâ Welcome! First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüçª

Feel free to contribute regardless of your age, gender, race or any other discriminating factor (Check out [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more) and contact us on [discord](https://discord.gg/mptG9ZGxTF) if you have any question, we are glad to have you here!

## How to contribute?

Armore is divided into 4 main repositories: _Android_, _iOs_, _Server_ & _Web_.
For now we are mainly open sourcing the Server repo to the community. If you are interested in collaborating with the android, iOs or Web code (which we will open soon) contact us!

You can collaborate with us by reporting **issues**, opening **pull requests** working on one or more issues, or contributing new **ideas/suggestions** in our discord server!

### Issues

Feel free to open an issue whenever:

- You want to report a **bug**
- You want to suggest **enhancements**
- You would like to add a **feature**

Make sure to use a clear and descriptive title for the issue.
Always try to write a description that helps us as much as possible to understand the bug/enhancement/feature you want to report. **Don't be shy!** Add as many details as you think necessary.

Also, **we will be opening issues** in which you will be able to collaborate:

- **Good first issues**:

  It may be the best option to get you started in the project. They will help you practice and become familiar with the code.

* **Help wanted issues**:

  These issues can be a little more challenging! They are probably priority tasks that we haven't had the time to do yet, or tasks we have in progress that we need help with!
